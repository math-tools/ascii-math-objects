/***
Set

A set ''S'' is simply an object with a "membership" operator ''S.in'' which
"associates" any object to a boolean-like value.

The following shortcuts are available without limit to the number of arguments.

    * ''x in S'' stands for ''S.in x = true''.

    * ''x y in S'' stands for the conjunction
    ''S.in x = true , S.in y = true''.

    * ''x y z in S'' stands for the conjunction
    ''S.in x = true , S.in y = true , S.in z = true''.

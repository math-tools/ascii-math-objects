    + desc
        A "plus-prod" field ''F'' is a field with the syntaxic shortcuts
        of a "plus-prod" ring.

    + note
        We could have extended just a ''DivRing'' type because of the
        abelian properties of the ''GroupPlus'' and ''GroupProd'' types.
        We choose the ''Field'' type in order to reflect the structure
        extensions made in mathematics.

Types.

    1) Concerning the \func.

        * ''equal'' of ''Set'' and ''MultiSet'' have been implemented.

        * The \syst knows that ''empty_set = empty_multiset'' thanks to the polymorphism of the special \func ''equal''.

        * Core functionalities: ''equal'' has a post-\cond to indicate the reflexitivy \prop.

    1) Concerning finite sets: new type ''ExplicitFiniteSet'' with associated \funcs ''add'', ''diff'', ''union'', ''disj_union'', ''prod''.

    1) Concerning \std algebraic \structs: ''op_ntimes'' for ''Monoid'' type with also ''ntimes'' alias for ''Add'' like \structs, and ''pow'' alias for ''Prod'' like \structs.

    1) Core \functios.

        * New \func ''iter_ntimes'' to apply ''nb'' times the same \appli on a start \val where ''nb in \N''.

        * New \func "for_toks_efset" can iterates over "{: a | b | c | ... :}".

Types.

    1) Natural and integer sets.

        * ''NatSet'' has been extended to ''TotalOrderedSet''.

        * ''IntSet : DomainAddProd'' has moved to ''IntSet : Set'' with ''equal'' function implemented, and been extended to ''TotalOrderedSet''.

        * Injection from ''NatSet'' into ''IntSet''.

    1) Changes for sets.

        * Each set has now an ''InSet'' type attribut.

        * New \func ''disj_union'' for disjunct union of two sets with its associated internal functions (projections and injections).

        * New ''OrderedSet'' and ''TotalOrderedSet'' types.

    1) New directive: ''is_pair'' is well named, and a pattern matching for pairs in the style of \python has been added.

    1) Core functionalities.

        * For iterations.

            i) New \function ''equal_iter'' to test if two \objs can be accesed by the same \nb of itertions of a given \ope.

            i) New \function ''lt_iter'' to test if an \obj uses more \nb of iterations of an \appli than another from a start \obj.

            i) New \function ''lte_iter'' to test if an \obj uses more or same \nb of iterations of an \appli than another from a start \obj.

        * Anonymous \var or \func, or unuseful name just has to be named ''_''.

        * Untyped and non-semantic \cst \symbs ''symb_0'', ''symb_1'' and ''symb_2'' added: they have the fixed "SymbType" type (it can't be subtyped).

        * It is now possible to use pointed \OP like syntax to add dynamically functions to one type.

        * Shortcuts like ''a = b = c = d'' for ''a = b and b = c and c = d'' are allowed.

        * Use of axioms is allowed inside the implementation of a \func (for example, this can indicate some pre-conditions).


[[:doc:]]
Naming.

    1) Names like ''__...__'' indicate a "dangerous" \obj.

    1) Names like ''_...'' are for unpublic \objs.


[[:tech:]]
The \func ''equal'' can't be recursive: when ''... = ...'' is used inside the implementation of ''equal'', we have to look for an ''equal'' \func using a weaker type. This needs change the initial test ''tokenize obj_1 = tokenize obj_2'' into ''same_tokens obj_1 obj_2''.


-------
:break:

[[:api:]]
Types.

    1) Explicit finite sets are typed ''{: ... :}'' instead of ''{ ... }'' because this last one was messy to use regarding the blocks of multiline intructions ''{ ... }''.

    1) We use now ''{*}'' for the empty multiset, but we keep the unambiguous ''{}'' for the empty "classical" set.

        * ''min'', ''max'' and ''diff_up''.

    1) New ''MultiSet'' and ''EmptyMultiSet'' types with ''sum'', ''union'', ''inter'' and ''diff'', but no ''prod''.

    1) The versatile ''equal'' has been implemented using the new directive ''same_tokens'' to test if we have the same writing after basic "full expansion": for example, ''succ (succ zero)'' is equal to itslef, but also to ''succ one'' if ''one := succ zero''.

    1) New directive: ''same_tokens'' (see the previous point).

    1) New things for sets.

        * \Cst ''empty_set'' that can be written ''{}''.

        * Product, union, intersection and difference of two sets implemented.

    1) The core \func ''iter_set'' and ''iter_set_ns'' have been added.

    1) Non lexical equalities between same typable \objs must be implemented using the special \func ''equal'' with \signs ''OneType -> OneType -> \B''.

        * Equality between ''Set'' type \objs specified.

        * Equality between natural \nbs added.

    1) New ''fix'' directive to avoid the change of \objs like the ''in'' \func of ''Set'' \obj (a \func can have \diff fixed version regarding the \sign used).
    From now, ''const'', ''var'' and ''func'' are basic internal fundamental kinds of \obj (''fix const'' is meaningless).

    1) Axioms use '':='' instead of '':'' for logical reasons.

    1) The \sign ''M -> M -> M'' is preferred to ''M * M -> M'' (it's more convenient).

        * ''or'' and ''and'' have the type ''\B -> \B -> \B''.

        * For magmas, ''op'' has the type ''M -> M -> M''.

    1) Use of ''NegSet'' and ''PosSet'' instead of ''Z_non_neg'' and ''Z_non_pos'' for the ''IntSet'' type.

    1) The path::''core'' folder groups together specific, indispensable functionalities such as the ''Untyped'' type, the booleans, the iterative constructions on set-like types....

    1) \Specs for natural \nb \objs become core ones.

    1) Boolean set implementing using a small trick.

    1) ''func'' can be implemnted: only match \ocmal-like can be used at this time.

    1) ''const'' automatically guesses the type.
